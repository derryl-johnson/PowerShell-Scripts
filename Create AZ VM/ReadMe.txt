The purpose of the "main script" in this directory was to mimic an Azure Runbook was used to build a new VM in Azure. The "main script" was designed to be interactive where it would connect to the Azure subscription, pull data from the subscription, and use that data to select the necessary options to build the VM. The other scripts were created to test each part of the VM building selections and then add to the "main script" as a function. This project is not completed.
