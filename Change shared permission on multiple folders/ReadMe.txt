This script was written to revoke the SMB shared folder permissions on a Windows file server. The CSV in this directory establishes the current shared permissions on each folder. When the script runs, it imports data from the CSV file row by row and saves it as a variable. One line of code will revoke all permissions while another line of code will restore the permissions. Comment the line of code that will not be used.
