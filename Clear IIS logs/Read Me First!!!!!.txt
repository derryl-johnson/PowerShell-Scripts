The following VBScript will check the age of each log file in a folder and will delete any log file older than a specified age. To customize the script for your purposes, simply change the name and path of the folder in line 1 of the script, and change the maximum age to the desired value in days, in line 2.

The script above will scan all subfolders, so it will process logs for ALL sites in and under the folder specified. If you want to limit the process to just a single site, change the path appropriately.

To run the script manually, execute the following script in an administrator command line: 

cscript.exe c:\scripts\retentionscript.vbs

Using a script to delete log files is a long-term, reliable solution to the problem of log files consuming disk space. If you automate the process, as shown below, it doesn't require constant maintenance.
