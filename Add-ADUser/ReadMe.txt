This script was used to create multiple new users in Active Directory while populating values in specific AD attributes and added to a designated AD grop. When the script runs, the data within the CSV file is imported row by row. Then the new user account is created in a specific OU. And lastly, it's added to the assigned group. In this AD environment, the Home Page attribute had to include the user's email address in order for the email account to function. Also, the UID and GID attribute was necessary for the user to log into a Linux server.
