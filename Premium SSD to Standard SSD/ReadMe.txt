The purpose of these scripts were to change the SSD on an Azure VM from premium SSD to standard SSD. The CSVs represents each Azure subscription containing SSDs that need to be converted and the resource group where they reside. Version one of the script is a proof of concept to demonstrate how it will change the disks from premium to standard. Version two of the script will allow the disks to be convert in each Azure subscription.

For the script to work, you must already be logged into an existing Azure subscription. When the script runs (v2), it will create a transcript log that will be exported when the script ends. Then, it will connect to a defined Azure subscription. After that, it will shutdown all defined VMs that contain disks that need to be converted. Once powered off, the CSV containing the list of disks will be imported. The info of each disk within Azure will be gathered and used to perform the conversion from premium to standard. After the conversions are complete, the VMs will power back on, and the script will connect to the next Azure subscription until it reaches the end where the log file stops and exported into a text file.
